	abstract = {The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

	abstract = {The ideal mathematical model for predicting survival for individual patients with primary biliary cirrhosis should be based on a small number of inexpensive, noninvasive measurements that are universally available. Such a model would be useful in medical management by aiding in the selection of patients for and timing of orthotopic liver transplantation. This paper describes the development, testing and use of a mathematical model for predicting survival. The Cox regression method and comprehensive data from 312 Mayo Clinic patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were used to derive a model based on patient's age, total serum bilirubin and serum albumin concentrations, prothrombin time and severity of edema. When cross-validated on an independent set of 106 Mayo Clinic primary biliary cirrhosis patients, the model predicted survival accurately. Our model was found to be comparable in quality to two other primary biliary cirrhosis survival models reported in the literature and to have the advantage of not requiring liver biopsy.},
